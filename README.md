# odin-restaurant-page

This project is a part of the full stack JavaScript course with the Odin Project.  

It is a simple restaraunt page mainly created to continue practicing DOM manipulation by dynamically rendering the page using only JavaScript to generate the entire contents of the website. (Styling is done in CSS but the DOM elements themselves are created with JS).  

This is also my first project utilising modules and using Webpack to bundle said modules.

Pizza logo was edited by me to remove the fill colour and make the outline white.
